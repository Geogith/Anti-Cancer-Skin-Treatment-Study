# Comparison of anti-skin Cancer treatments

The purpose of my study was to compare anti-cancer skin treatment Capomulin versus other skin cancer treatments. The study was performed using 249 mice. The 45 days study observed and measured scc tumor growths in mice to determine the efficacy of Capomulin compared to other skin cancer treatments. The study provided a summary of observations and insights using tables and figures to present the study results. 

# Results of study
                   
   Observation 1.) Bar plots and Pie charts show total number of mice for each treatment(10) were evenly distributed
                   amongst the sexes. Therefore, the study results are not bias to any particular sex.
   Observation 2.) Mouse C326 using Infubinol regimen had one outlier compared to the other three promising drug treatments.
   Observation 3.) Capomulin line plot for Mouse S185 shows the Tumor Volume decreases with time.
   Observation 4.) Capomulin scatter plot shows a reduction of mouse weight as tumor volume decreases.
   Observation 5.) Fnally, linear regression line shows a positive relationship (independent and dependentht variables go up)
                   between tumor volume and weight using Capomulin drug regimen. Thereby confirming (along with the line
                   and scatter plots) the Capomulin is the most promising anti-cancer skin treatment compared to the others
                   based on using mice for testing.
