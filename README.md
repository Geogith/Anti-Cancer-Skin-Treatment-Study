# Cancer Treatment Analysis

  # Purpose 
  
Anti-cancer skin treatment Capomulin was compared to other skin cancer treatments. The analysis was performed using 249 mice. For 45 days scc tumor growths in mice were observed and measured to determine the efficacy of Capomulin compared to other skin cancer treatments. The results of the analysis tells a compelling story by presenting the data visually. To do this Matplotlib and NumPy were used. Matplotlib is a comprehensive plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations when using Python progamming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy  .
NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter,

  # Results

The completed analysis provides a summary of observations and hidden insights using tables and figures. 
                   
   Observation 1.) Bar plots and Pie charts show total number of mice for each treatment(10) were evenly distributed
                   amongst the sexes. Therefore, the study results are not bias to any particular sex.
   Observation 2.) Mouse C326 using Infubinol regimen had one outlier compared to the other three promising drug treatments.
   Observation 3.) Capomulin line plot for Mouse S185 shows the Tumor Volume decreases with time.
   Observation 4.) Capomulin scatter plot shows a reduction of mouse weight as tumor volume decreases.
   Observation 5.) Fnally, linear regression line shows a positive relationship (independent and dependentht variables go up)
                   between tumor volume and weight using Capomulin drug regimen. Thereby confirming (along with the line
                   and scatter plots) the Capomulin is the most promising anti-cancer skin treatment compared to the others
                   based on using mice for testing.
